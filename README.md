# RaidingWithLeashes
WoW addon to list instances that have pets yet to be collected for the Raiding With Leashes achievements.

## Usage
1. Copy the RaidingWithLeashes directory to your WoW Interface folder (e.g.: C:\Program Files (x86)\World of Warcraft\_retail_\Interface\Addons)
2. Enter ```/rwl``` into the chatbox to list pets you still need
3. Go get the pets

## Todo
* Add lockout availability listing
* Add colourization to make things easier to read
* Maybe add an actual UI
* Reminders when zoning into an instance
* A way to programatically retrieve drop info? It's a hardcoded table right now, so it's guaranteed to break for non-enUS clients, probably.
